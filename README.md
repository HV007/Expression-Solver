# Expression-Solver
This is an attempt to evaluate arithmetic expressions using Machine Learning. The model divides the image into areas where it expects the digits and operator. It classifies the digits using a model pretrained on MNIST dataset. The operators are classified by a fresh model. Refer to `solver.ipynb` for details.
